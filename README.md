# WARNING

symbol-viewer was developed when php-integrator-base was around version 0.7 a few months ago.
Due to personal reasons I'm temporarily not able to maintain it and it's not going to work with php-integrator-base >=1.0.
If you would like to help with development and publishing of the package please let me know at bobrowicz.michal@gmail.com. Sorry for the inconvenience.
